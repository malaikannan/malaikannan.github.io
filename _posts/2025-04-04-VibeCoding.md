# VibeCoding

As a CTO, I donâ€™t typically get a lot of time to sit and codeâ€”thereâ€™s a lot of grunt work involved in my role. Quite a bit of my time goes into the operational aspects of running an engineering team: feature prioritization, production issue reviews, cloud cost reviews, one-on-ones, status updates, budgeting, etc.

Although Iâ€™m deeply involved in architecture, design, and scaling decisions, Iâ€™m not contributing as a senior developer writing code for features in the product as much as Iâ€™d like. Itâ€™s not just about writing codeâ€”itâ€™s about maintaining it. And with everything else I do, I felt I didnâ€™t have the time or energy to maintain a complex feature.

Over the past couple of yearsâ€”apart from AI research workâ€”my coding has been pretty much limited to pair programming or contributing to some minor, non-critical features. Sometimes I end up writing small utilities here and there.

## Pair Programming as a Connection Tool

I love to pair program with at least two engineers for a couple of hours every week. This gives me an opportunity to connect with them 1:1, understand the problems on the ground, and help them see the bigger picture of how the features theyâ€™re working on fit into our product ecosystem.

1:1s were never effective for me. In that 30-minute window, engineers rarely open up. But if you sit and code for 2â€“3 hours at a stretch, you get to learn a lot about themâ€”their problem-solving approach, what motivates them, and more.

I also send out a weekly video update to the engineering team, where I talk about the engineers I pair programmed with, their background, and what we worked on. It helps the broader engineering team learn more about their peers as well.

## The Engineer in Me

The engineer in me always wants to get back to codingâ€”because there's no joy quite like building something and making it work. Iâ€™m happiest when I code.

Iâ€™ve worked in several languages over the yearsâ€”Java, VB6, C#, Perl, good old shell scripting, Python, JavaScript, and more. Once I found Python, I never looked back. I absolutely love the Python community.

I've been a full-stack developer throughout my career. My path to becoming a CTO was non-traditional (thatâ€™s a story for another blog). I started in a consulting firm and worked across different projects and tech stacks early on, which helped me become a well-rounded full-stack engineer.

I still remember building a simple timesheet entry application in 2006 using HTML and JavaScript (with AJAX) for a clientâ€™s invoicing needs. It was a small utility, but it made timesheet entry so much easier for engineers. That experience stuck with me.

I'll get to why being a full-stack engineer helped me build the app using VibeCoding shortly.

## The Spark: Coffee with Shuveb Hussain

I was catching up over coffee with **Shuveb Hussain**, founder and CEO of **ZipStack**. Their product, **Unstract**, is really good for extracting entities from different types of documents. Theyâ€™ve even open-sourced a versionâ€”go check it out.

Shuveb, being a seasoned engineerâ€™s engineer, mentioned how GenAI code editors helped him quickly build a few apps for his own use over a weekend. That sparked something in me: why wasnâ€™t I automating my grunt work with one of these GenAI code editors?

Iâ€™ve used GitHub Copilot for a while, but these newer GenAI editorsâ€”like Cursor and Windsurfâ€”are in a different league. Based on Shuvebâ€™s recommendation, I chose **Windsurf**.

Letâ€™s be honest thoughâ€”I donâ€™t remember any weekend project of mine that ended in just one weekend ðŸ˜…

## The Grunt Work I Wanted to Automate

I was looking for ways to automate the boring but necessary stuff, so I could focus more on external-facing activities.

Every Thursday, I spent about **6 hours analyzing production issues** before the weekly Friday review with engineering leaders, the SRE team, product leads, and support. Iâ€™d get a CSV dump of all the tickets and manually go through each one to identify patterns or repeated issues. Then Iâ€™d start asking questions on Slack or during the review meeting.

The process was painful and time-consuming. I did this for over 6 months and knew I needed to change something.

In addition to that:
- I regularly reviewed **cloud compute costs** across environments and products to identify areas for optimization.
- I monitored **feature usage metrics** to see what customers actually used.
- I examined **job runtime stats** (itâ€™s a low-code platform, so this matters).
- I looked at **engineering team metrics** from the operations side.

Each of these lived in different tools, dashboards, or portals. I was tired of logging into 10 places and context-switching constantly while fielding distractions.

## The Build Begins: CTO Dashboard

I decided to build an internal tool I nicknamed **CTODashboard**â€”to consolidate everything I needed.

### My Tech Stack (via Windsurf):
- **Frontend**: ReactJS  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)  
- **Database**: Postgres  
- **Deployment**: EC2 (with some help from the SRE team)

I used Windsurfâ€™s Cascade interface to prompt out code, even while attending meetings. It was surprisingly effective... except for one time when a prompt completely messed up my dayâ€™s work. Lesson learned: **commit code at every working logical step**.

In a couple of days, I had:
- A feature to upload the CSV dump
- Filters to slice and dice data
- A paginated data table
- Trend analytics with visualizations

Even when I hit errors, I just screenshot them or pasted logs into Windsurf and asked it to fix them. It did a decent job. When it hallucinated or got stuck, I just restarted with a fresh Cascade.

I had to rewrite the CSV upload logic manually when the semantic mapping to the backend tables went wrong. But overall, 80% of the code was generatedâ€”20% I wrote myself. And I reviewed everything to ensure it worked as intended.

## Early Feedback & Iteration

I gave access to a couple of colleagues for early feedback. It was overwhelmingly positive. They even suggested new features like:
- Summarizing long tickets
- Copy-pasting ticket details directly into Slack
- Copying visualizations without taking screenshots

I implemented all of those using Windsurf in just a few more days.

In under a week, I had an MVP that **cut my Thursday analysis time from 6+ hours to under 2**.

Then **Abhay Dhandekar**, another senior developer, offered to help. He built a **Lambda function** to call our Helpdesk API every hour to fetch the latest tickets and updates. He got it working in 4 hoursâ€”like a boss.

## Growing Usage

Word about the dashboard started leaking (okay, I may have leaked it myself ðŸ˜‰). As more people requested access, I had to:
- Add **Google Sign-In**
- Implement **authorization controls**
- Build a **user admin module**
- Secure the backend APIs with proper access control
- Add **audit logs** to track who was using what

I got all this done over a weekend. It consumed my entire weekend, but it was worth it.

## AWS Cost Analytics Module

Next, I added a module to analyze **AWS cost trends** across production and non-prod environments by product.

Initially, it was another CSV upload feature. Later, Abhay added a Lambda to fetch the data daily. I wanted engineering directors to **see the cost implications** of design decisionsâ€”especially when non-prod environments were always-on.

Before this, I spent **30 minutes daily** reviewing AWS cost trends. Once the dashboard launched, engineers started checking it themselves. That awareness led to much smarter decisions and **significant cost savings**.

I added visualizations for:
- Daily cost trends
- Monthly breakdowns
- Environment-specific views
- Product-level costs

## More Modules Coming Soon

Iâ€™ve since added:
- **Usage metrics**
- **Capitalization tracking**
- **(In progress)**: Performance and engineering metrics

The dashboard now has **200+ users**, and Iâ€™m releasing access in batches to manage performance.

## Lessons Learned from VibeCoding

This was a fun experiment to see how far I could go with GenAI-based development using just prompts.

### What I Learned:
1. **Strong system design fundamentals are essential.**
2. **Windsurf can get stuck in loopsâ€”step in and take control.**
3. **Commit frequently. Mandatory.**
4. **Youâ€™re also the testerâ€”donâ€™t skip this.**
5. **If the app breaks badly, roll back. Donâ€™t fix bad code.**
6. **GenAI editors are great for senior engineers; less convinced about junior devs.**
7. **Model training cutoffs matterâ€”it affects library choices.**
8. **Write smart prompts with guardrails (e.g., "no files >300 lines").**
9. **GenAI tools struggle to edit large files** (my `app.py` hit 5,000 lines; I had to refactor manually).
10. **Use virtual environments**â€”GenAI often forgets.
11. **Deployments are tedious**â€”I took help from the SRE team for Jenkins/Terraform setup.
12. **If you love coding, VibeCoding is addictive.**

## Gratitude

Special thanks to:
- **Bhavani Shankar, Navin Kumaran, Geetha Eswaran, and Sabyasachi Rout** for helping with deployment scripts and automation (yes, I bugged them a lot).
- **Pravin Kumar, Vikas Kishore, Nandini PS, and Prithviraj Subburamanian** for feedback and acting as de facto product managers for dashboard features.
