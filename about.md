  Hi this is Malaikannan Sankarasubbu. This is my personal page, opinions expressed here are mine not of my employers. You will find my ramblings about technology, politics, philosphy and sports. I am a programmer, have been programming nearly for 20 years now. I use to love Object oriented programming, but have crossed over to the dark side of functional programming and scripting. I can rave about how good Python is as a Programming Language all day long. I love Artificial Intelligence, i am active in the Deep Learning community. I kick off training Deep Learning models in winter to keep my room warm. If I didn't meet my wife in Scranton airport, i would have moved to Alaska and probably you would have seen me in the outdoor shows with me riding a snowmobile in dead of Alaskan winter. I have a young family, my handsome and intelligent son is 12 years old, i am married to my beautiful wife for 13 years now. Previously I was founder and CTO at Datalog.ai, currently leading Engineering and AI Research teams in Saama Technologies.
